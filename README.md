# Data Science for Business: Employee Attrition Prediction

## Overview

This project focuses on predicting employee attrition (employee turnover) using machine learning techniques. Employee attrition is a significant concern for businesses, as it leads to increased costs and decreased productivity. By building a predictive model, companies can identify employees who are at high risk of leaving and take proactive measures to retain them.

**Based on the sample dataset provided, which includes data on factors like Job Involvement, Education, Job Satisfaction, Performance Rating, Relationship Satisfaction, and Work-Life Balance, we aim to build a model that accurately predicts which employees are likely to quit.**

## Business Problem

Employee attrition has several negative consequences for a business:

*   **Increased costs:** Recruiting, hiring, and training new employees is expensive.
*   **Decreased productivity:** New employees typically require time to reach the same level of productivity as experienced employees.
*   **Loss of knowledge and skills:** When employees leave, they take their knowledge and experience with them.
*   **Disruption of projects and teams:** Employee turnover can disrupt ongoing projects and negatively impact team dynamics.

By predicting which employees are likely to leave, businesses can:

*   **Implement targeted retention strategies:** Offer bonuses, promotions, training opportunities, or other incentives to at-risk employees.
*   **Improve employee satisfaction:** Identify and address factors that contribute to employee dissatisfaction, such as poor work-life balance or lack of career growth opportunities.
*   **Reduce attrition rates:** Ultimately, reduce the overall employee turnover rate and its associated costs.

## Data

The dataset used in this project is from [IBM HR Analytics Employee Attrition & Performance](https://www.kaggle.com/pavansubhasht/ibm-hr-analytics-attrition-dataset) available on Kaggle.  It contains information about various employee attributes, including:

*   **JobInvolvement:** Level of employee engagement in their job.
*   **Education:** Employee's level of education.
*   **JobSatisfaction:** Employee's level of satisfaction with their job.
*   **PerformanceRating:** Employee's performance rating.
*   **RelationshipSatisfaction:** Employee's level of satisfaction with workplace relationships.
*   **WorkLifeBalance:** Employee's perception of work-life balance.
*   **Age:** Employee's age.
*   **Department:** Department in which the employee works.
*   **Gender:** Employee's gender.
    ... and many more!

The target variable is `Attrition`, which indicates whether an employee has left the company (Yes/No).

## Methods

The following machine learning techniques were explored for building the attrition prediction model:

*   **Artificial Neural Networks (ANN):** A complex model able to detect complex relationships between features.
*   **Logistic Regression:** A linear model used to estimate the probability of an event occuring.
*   **Random Forest:** An ensembled technique that combines many decision trees to improve prediction accuracy.

Evaluation Metrics used:
*   **Confusion Matrix:** A table that describes the performance of a classification model
*   **Classification Accuracy:** Number of correct predictions over the total predictions
*   **Precision:** From the values predicted as positives, how many were actually positives
*   **Recall:** From the actual positives, how many were predicted as positives
*   **F1 Score:** Combination of precision and recall in a single value.

Explain any feature engineering steps taken (e.g., creating dummy variables for categorical features, scaling numerical features).

## Results

*   **Model Performance Comparison:** Briefly summarize the performance of each model on the test dataset, highlighting the best-performing model. Use the evaluation metrics mentioned above and justify your choice.
*   **Key Predictors:** Identify the most important features that contribute to predicting employee attrition. This can be determined through feature importance analysis (e.g., using feature importances from a Random Forest model).

## Conclusion

Summarize the key findings of the project and their implications for business decision-making.  For example:

*   "Our analysis suggests that [key predictor 1] and [key predictor 2] are the most important factors contributing to employee attrition."
*   "The [best-performing model] achieved a [F1-score] on the test dataset, demonstrating its ability to accurately identify employees at risk of leaving."
*   "By using this model, companies can proactively address employee concerns and implement targeted retention strategies to reduce attrition rates and save costs."

## Future Work

*   **Collect additional data:** Gather more data on employee attributes and external factors that may influence attrition.
*   **Explore other modeling techniques:** Experiment with different machine learning algorithms and hyperparameter tuning to improve model performance.
*   **Develop a real-time attrition prediction system:** Create a system that continuously monitors employee data and provides real-time predictions of attrition risk.
*   **Conduct a cost-benefit analysis:** Evaluate the financial impact of implementing the attrition prediction system and retention strategies.
